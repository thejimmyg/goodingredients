Recipes
+++++++

If you haven't already done so it is a good idea to read the `ingredients
section <../ingredients/index.html>`_ to give you a good idea of why I've
chosen the components I have. It isn't that I am being sponsored by one
organisation or another, or even that the ingerdients I've chosen are
necessarily the best in their class. I've chosen them because they all fit the
good ingredients definition of good (see `What is good?
<../what-is-good.html>`_) and they all work well together and are likely to
continue working well together in the future.

The recipes themselves are divided into three categories:

`Core <articles/index.html>`_
    Approved recipes which you are recommended to follow

Translations
    Translations of the core recipes into different languages

Contrib
    Other people's takes on the core recipes using different ingredients or
    taking different approaches or related recipes which extend the core recepies
    or provide related information

At the moment only the `core recepies <articles/index.html>`_ have been put
online but if you'd like to contribute please `contact 3aims Ltd
<http://3aims.com/contact.html>`_ with your contribution.
